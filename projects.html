            <h1>QLearn</h1>
            <p>
                I'm sure by now all of us students are tired of the annoying homemade homework websites we are forced to use in our classes. With QLearn, assigning and completing
                homework is made easy. QLearn is a very simple userfriendly homework assigning website in which teachers can post custom announcements and problem sets for their
                students. Likewise, students can then submit their answers to the problem sets which can then be viewed by the teacher.

        <h1>Money Printer</h1>
        <p>
            Everyone wishes they could discover a way to make quick passive income. Well, the console based application, Money Printer, might just be that. Money Printer is
            a mock cryptocurrency trading bot that trades on a minutely timeframe. Money Printer acquires data on various coins via Kraken's crypto exchange API, and then calculates
            formulas for common trading indicators such as the relative strength index. From there, Money Printer searches for trends and signals amongst the indicators in order
            to determine the opportune buy and sell timings of cryptocurrencies. So far before fees, Money Printer actually has the ability to make money especially during
            bullish markets, meaning it might be soon time to let it trade on my real portfolio...

        <h1>Photo Filter</h1>
        <p>
            Well, Photoshop has definitely beaten me to this idea... Anyways, photo filter is a console based application which can apply various imaging filters
            to PNG files. The filters include, grayscale, blur, reflection, and edge detection. What the program does, is it takes in a PNG file and filter type via command line
            arguement, and then writes a new PNG file with the requested filter applied to the requested image.

        <h1>Spell Checker</h1>
        <p>
            Spell checkers are very common amongst many applications, soo why not make my own. Pretty much all this application does is take in 2 text files, one containing
            a piece of text to be spell checked, and another that contains a dictionary, then a list of words that are spelled wrong are printed in the console. The 
            application then formats the dictionary into a hash table which significantly reduces runtime. From there the program runs through the text and checks each 
            word to see if it also exists in the hash table, if not the word is considered misspelled and is printed in the console.
