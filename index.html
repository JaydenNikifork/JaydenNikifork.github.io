            Hello everyone, my name is Jayden Nikifork and I am currently a first year student at McMaster's general engineering program. Despite being an engineering student,
            my passion lies in software development which is why I am planning on specializing in software engineering come second year. This E-Portfolio website that I have created
            from scratch is designed to showcase my coding projects as well as my real life accomplishments. I have a few--what are in my opinion--cool projects right now and will
            hopefully have more, even cooler projects to come in the future. Anyways, back to who I am, outside of coding I love althletics, especially body building, and track and
            field. Back in elementary and high school I used to participate semi-successfully on the track team, and more recently during my time in high school I was a
            frequent member of the school's fitness club. To round out my hobbies, I also play League of Legends (peak elo: Diamond 2) and chess (peak elo: 1600), so as a TLDR, 
            I'm a pretty simple guy. For my future, I have aspirations of one day running my own software development company, you know like Bills Gates or one of those other guys.
            However, in the mean time I plan on working as a software engineer where I can learn the ropes. Anyways, I'm sure by now you are tired of reading what seems like a 
            10 page essay, so please feel free to take a look around the different webpages of my E-Portfolio. Enjoy your stay!
